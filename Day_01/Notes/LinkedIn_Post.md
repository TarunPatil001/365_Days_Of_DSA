# 📅 Day 1 / 365 – DSA & Problem-Solving Patterns

**Today’s Topic:** 𝐓𝐰𝐨 𝐏𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫

## What I learned today:

- Converging pointers: Used left / right to compare ends and shrink the search space efficiently (common for palindromes and sorted arrays).
- Sorted arrays unlock the pattern: Sorting often enables predictable pointer movement (increase left or decrease right based on the condition).

## Approach I applied:

- 𝐈𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐟𝐲 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐩𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧: Does the problem involve comparing elements from both ends? → Two Pointer.
- 𝐂𝐡𝐨𝐨𝐬𝐞 𝐩𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐲: Converging (opposite ends) vs Same-direction (fast/slow).
- 𝐃𝐞𝐟𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐦𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐫𝐮𝐥𝐞𝐬: What condition moves left? What moves right?
- 𝐇𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐥𝐞 𝐞𝐝𝐠𝐞 𝐜𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐬: Empty input, single element, all duplicates.

## Questions I solved:

- Valid Palindrome
- Reverse String
- Squares of a Sorted Array
- Valid Palindrome II
- Valid Word Abbreviation

**Reflection:** Today was about building momentum and consistency. I focused on simpler problems to strengthen fundamentals and write clean, correct Java implementations.
