# 📘 DSA Pattern-Based Notes Template

> **Purpose:** Create clean, visual, and revision-friendly notes while learning DSA through patterns and solving problems simultaneously.

---

## 🧩 1. Pattern Name

> *(Example: Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Binary Search on Answer)*

* **Category:** Array / String / Linked List / Tree / Graph / DP / Greedy
* **Difficulty Level:** Easy / Medium / Hard
* **Use Case:** When should this pattern be applied?

---

## 🧠 2. Intuition (Very Important)

> Explain the idea in **simple words** (as if teaching a beginner).

* What problem does this pattern solve?
* Why does it work?
* What is the key observation?

📝 *Tip:* Write in plain English, avoid code here.

---

## 🖼️ 3. Visual Explanation / Diagram

> Draw or imagine the flow.

```
Example Diagram (Two Pointers)

[ 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 ]
  ↑           ↑
 left        right
```

* Pointer movement explanation
* State changes
* Important transitions

📌 *You can redraw this neatly in notebook or tools like Excalidraw / Draw.io*

## 🧪 4. Dry Run (Step-by-Step)

| Step | State / Variables | Action  | Result |
| ---- | ----------------- | ------- | ------ |
| 1    | l=0, r=4          | Compare | Move l |
| 2    | l=1, r=4          | Compare | Move r |

---

## 🧠 5. Algorithm Steps

> Write this like logic, not code.

1. Initialize required variables
2. Traverse using condition
3. Update answer
4. Move pointers / update state
5. Return result

---

## 💻 6. Pseudocode

```
Initialize variables
While condition is true:
    Perform operation
    Update pointers / window
Return answer
```

---

## 🧾 7. Code Implementation

### 🔹 Language: Java / C++ / Python

```java
// Write clean, commented code
```

---

## ⏱️ 8. Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** O(n)
* **Space Complexity:** O(1) / O(n)

Explain **why**.

---

## ⚠️ 9. Edge Cases

* Empty input
* Single element
* Maximum constraints
* Duplicate values

---

## 🔁 10. Similar Problems

| Problem Name | Platform | Link |
| ------------ | -------- | ---- |
| Two Sum      | LeetCode |      |

---

## 🧠 11. Pattern Recognition Tips

* Keywords in question
* Constraints hinting the pattern
* Brute force vs optimized

---

## ❌ 12. Common Mistakes

* Off-by-one error
* Incorrect pointer movement
* Missing edge case

---

## 🏁 13. Final Takeaway (1–2 lines)

> One strong learning or insight from this pattern.

---

## 📌 14. Revision Checklist ✅

* [ ] I understand the intuition
* [ ] I can explain without code
* [ ] I can dry run confidently
* [ ] I can identify this pattern in new problems

---

## 🔥 15. Practice Status

* Problems Solved: ___ / ___
* Confidence Level: ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆
* Last Revised On: ___

---

📎 *Best Practice:* Maintain **one pattern = one master note**, keep adding solved problems under it.
