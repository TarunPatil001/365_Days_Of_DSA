📅 Day 2 / 365 – DSA & Problem-Solving Patterns

Today's Topic: 𝐇𝐚𝐬𝐡𝐌𝐚𝐩 + 𝐓𝐰𝐨 𝐏𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬

🧠 What I learned today:
• 💡 Two Sum clicked once I thought of it as "have I already seen the number I need?" — just store values in a HashMap and check.
• 💡 Two pointers after sorting makes pair counting way easier than brute force.
• 💡 Merging sorted arrays from the end is a small trick but saves a lot of headache.

🛠️ Approach I applied:
• 𝐈𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐟𝐲 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐩𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧: Is it about finding a complement? HashMap. Is it about counting pairs in sorted data? Two pointers.
• 𝐃𝐞𝐟𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐦𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐫𝐮𝐥𝐞𝐬: When should I move left pointer vs right? This decides everything.
• 𝐇𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐥𝐞 𝐞𝐝𝐠𝐞 𝐜𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐬: Empty arrays, single element, duplicates — almost tripped on a couple of these.

✅ Questions I solved:
🔹 Two Sum (Easy)
🔹 Merge Sorted Array (Easy)
🔹 Count Pairs Whose Sum is Less than Target (Easy)

💭 Reflection: Starting to see how recognizing the pattern early makes everything else fall into place. Day 2 done ✅
